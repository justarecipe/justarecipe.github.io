INGREDIENTS

* 2 cups rice
* 3 cups water
* 1 lb beef top round, cut against the grain into very thin two-inch-long pieces
* 1/3 cup Korean red pepper paste ([Gochujang](https://www.kroger.com/p/sempio-gochujang-hot-pepper-paste/0880100552345))
* 2 Tbsp. toasted sesame oil
* 1 Tbsp. soy sauce
* 1 Tbsp. sugar
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/4 cup water
* 12 oz. medium shiitake mushrooms, stemmed
* 1 seedless English cucumber, thinly sliced
* 1/4 cup rice vinegar
* 5 oz. fresh baby spinach
* shredded carrots
* sesame seeds/green onions (optional)
* salt

Cook rice and water in a medium pot on the stove, following the cooking instructions on package.

In a large bowl, combine the red pepper paste, sesame oil, soy sauce, sugar, garlic and water. Whisk until smooth and set aside 1/2 cup of sauce. With the remainder of the sauce in the bowl, add the beef and a grind of salt. Toss to coat and let marinate in the refrigerator for 10 minutes or even overnight.

Add the beef, sauce and mushrooms to the Instant Pot (IP). Place the lid on the IP and make sure the float valve is set to closed. Select Manual Pressure and program 10 minutes. 

Once the rice is on and the beef and mushrooms are in the IP, slice the cucumber and place in a shallow bowl. Add the rice vinegar and a few grinds of salt. Toss and set aside.

Once the IP timer beeps, do a Quick Release until all the pressure has been released. Remove lid and stir the beef and mushrooms.

Assemble the rice bowls with cooked rice, beef and mushrooms, cucumber, spinach, and shredded carrots and then drizzle the bowl with the red pepper sauce set aside earlier. Top with sliced green onions or sesame seeds and serve immediately.
