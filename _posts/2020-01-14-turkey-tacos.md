_An easy weeknight meal using ground turkey, homemade taco seasoning, tortillas and your favorite taco toppings._

INGREDIENTS

* 1 Tbsp. olive oil
* 1 lb. ground turkey
* 1 Tbsp. chili powder
* 1 tsp. cumin
* 1/2 tsp. paprika
* 1/2 tsp. garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp. onion powder
* 1/2 cup tomato sauce
* 1/2 cup chicken broth
* flour tortilla shells
* head of green leaf lettuce, rinsed and shredded
* favorite shredded cheese (cheddar, Monterey Jack)
* favorite taco toppings like salsa, hot sauce, avocado, sour cream or diced tomato

Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add ground turkey and brown until cooked through (roughly 10 minutes). Make sure to break apart the turkey as it browns, so that the meat is evenly cooked and the right texture. Add chili powder, cumin, paprika, onion powder and garlic powder.

Stir until the spices are evenly coated on the ground turkey. Then add the chicken broth and tomato sauce, stirring well. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for five minutes until the sauce is reduced, stirring occasionally.

To prepare your tacos, microwave the flour tortilla shells for a few seconds to make them pliable and assemble with meat, shredded lettuce, shredded cheese and other taco topping favorites.
