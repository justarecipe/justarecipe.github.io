Time: 10 minutes; Yields: 2 dozen or so cake balls

_Sunbutter, oatflour and sprinkles come together for a sweet protein-rich and peanut-free treat._ 

INGREDIENTS

* 1 cup sunbutter
* 2/3 cup oat flour*
* 1/4 cup maple syrup
* 1 tsp. vanilla extract
* 1 tsp. butter extract
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 1/4 cup sprinkles

In a large mixing stand, add in all the ingredients except the sprinkles. Mix until uniform. Add then sprinkles and then mix again.

Use a mini cookie scoop to form the sunbutter cake balls. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator. 

\*You can make your own oat flour by adding instant oats to a high-powered mixer like a Vitamix and blending on high for a few seconds.
