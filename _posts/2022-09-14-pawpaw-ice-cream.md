_A delicious, frozen treat to enjoy during pawpaw season! The simple four-ingredient ice cream comes together effortlessly with the help of a KitchenAid mixer stand and ice cream maker attachment._

* 3/4 cup pawpaw pulp*
* 6 Tbsp. white sugar
* 1 cup heavy whipping cream
* 1 cup whole milk

Combine fresh pawpaw pulp and sugar in standing mixer. Beat until well combined. Whisk in the heavy cream and milk. Store the sweet pawpaw mixture in an airtight container for 2 hours or overnight.

Use a fully frozen [KitchenAid®](https://www.kitchenaid.com/countertop-appliances/stand-mixers/attachments/p.ice-cream-maker-attachment.ksmicm.html "Shop the KitchenAid® Ice Cream Maker attachment") [Ice Cream Maker attachment](https://www.kitchenaid.com/countertop-appliances/stand-mixers/attachments/p.ice-cream-maker-attachment.ksmicm.html "Shop the KitchenAid® Ice Cream Maker attachment") and attach to the stand. (Freeze for at least 15 to 24 hours.) Remove the chilled pawpaw mixture and slowly pour into the ice cream maker as it churns. Do not add the chilled pawpaw mixture until the paddle is in motion. Churn for 20 to 30 minutes as the mixture begins to resemble soft serve ice cream.

Serve immediately or scrape ice cream into an airtight container and place immediately in the freezer.

\*Depending on the size of the paw paws, you may need 6-7 fresh, ripe pawpaws to yield 3/4 cup pulp. Pawpaws are in season across some eastern regions of the United States in early September.
