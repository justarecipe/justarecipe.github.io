_A delicious and relatively easy snickerdoodle cookie with a pumpkin twist. This recipe delivers soft and chewy cookies with a taste of pumpkin and spice._

INGREDIENTS FOR COOKIE DOUGH

* 2 sticks unsalted butter, room temperature
* 2/3 cup white sugar
* 2/3 cup dark brown sugar, packed
* 1/2 Tbsp. vanilla extract
* 6 Tbsp. pumpkin puree
* 2  3/4 cups all purpose flour
* 1  1/2 tsp. cream of tartar
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1 tsp. baking soda
* 1 tsp. ground cinnamon
* 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice

INGREDIENTS FOR SUGAR COATING

1/4 cup white sugar

1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice

Heat oven to 325 degrees. Line a baking tray with parchment paper and set aside.

In a large bowl or standing mixer, add the butter, white sugar and brown sugar. Beat on medium speed until smooth. Add in the pumpkin puree and vanilla. Beat on medium speed until just combined.

In a separate bowl, add the dry ingredients: flour, cream of tartar, salt, baking soda, cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice. Whisk to combine.

Add the dry ingredients to the wet. Scrape down bowl as necessary. Mix until just combined.

In a small bowl, combine sugar and pumpkin pie spice. Mix together.

Use a small scoop to gather a bit of dough. Roll into a perfect ball and then form it into a tall cylinder. This shape helps the cookie to bake into a chewy and perfect texture.

Take the tall cylinder of dough and roll it into the bowl of sugar and pumpkin pie spice. Place on the parchment-paper-lined tray. Bake for 9 to 11 minutes and let cool on a wire rack.
