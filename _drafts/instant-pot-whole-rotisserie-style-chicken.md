_This recipe is an easy way to transform a raw whole chicken into moist and tender shredded "rotisserie" chicken that's perfect in dozens of recipes or just as is!_

INGREDIENTS

* 1/2 tsp. paprika
* 1 tsp. garlic powder
* 1 tsp. onion powder
* 1 tsp. lemon pepper
* 2 tsp. salt
* 1 tsp. sugar
* 2 Tbsp. olive oil
* 1 whole chicken, giblets removed
* 1 cup chicken broth

Place the chicken on a plate and pat dry. Combine the spices in a small bowl and add the oil. Stir until incorporated and rub half the oil and spice mixture on the breast side of the chicken.

Turn the Instant Pot to the Saute setting. Place the whole chicken in the pot with the seasoned side down. Rub the remaining oil and spice mixture on the other side of the chicken. After four minutes of searing the breast side, use very sturdy tongs to flip the chicken to the other side. Sear for another four minutes.

Flipping a whole chicken is awkward but arm yourself with a few tools like tongs or a large serving fork and you'll get the job done just fine. Searing the meat is a "don't-skip-step" because it introduces flavors to the meat that cooking under high pressure only wouldn't deliver. So get awkward and flip it.

Next add your chicken broth and close the lid on the Instant Pot. Set the gasket to seal and program the IP to Manual High Pressure for 25 minutes. Once the 25 minutes have eclipsed, allow the IP to do a Natural Release for 20 minutes.

Remove the IP lid and transfer to a serving plate. Or begin the process of shredding the chicken if you're using it in another recipe.
