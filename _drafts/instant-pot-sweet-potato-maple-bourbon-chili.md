_A hearty vegetarian chili that packs up a punch with sweet potatoes, a variety of beans,  and a splash of bourbon and maple syrup -- and it cooks to perfection in the Instant Pot!_

INGREDIENTS

* 1 Tbsp. olive oil
* 1 small onion, diced
* 2 gloves garlic, minced
* 4 cups sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed into roughly 1/2" pieces
* 1 1/2 Tbsp. chili powder
* 2 tsp. cumin
* 1/2 tsp. paprika
* 1/4 cayenne pepper
* 2 cups vegetarian broth
* 1 15 oz. can kidney beans, drained and rinsed
* 1 15 oz. can garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed
* 1 15 oz. can fire roasted diced tomatoes
* 1/4 cup bourbon
* 2 Tbsp. maple syrup
* salt and pepper, to taste
* tortilla strips for topping

Set the Instant Pot to Saute and add the oil. Once the oil is hot, add the onion and stir occasionally for five minutes or until onions are translucent. Add the garlic and saute another few seconds. Then add the sweet potatoes and stir.

Add the spices (chili powder, cumin, paprika and cayenne pepper) and stir until the spices have coated the sweet potatoes. Then add the broth, beans, tomatoes, maple syrup and bourbon. Place the lid on the IP and make sure the float valve is set to closed. Select Manual Pressure and program 15 minutes.

Once the timer beeps, do a Quick Release until all the pressure has been released. Remove lid and serve with tortilla strips (or cheese, if you please)!
