Time: 45 minutes; Serves 4 as a meal or more as an appetizer

* Pre-made pizza dough (Or make your own! Recipe coming soon!)
* 8 ounces sliced or shredded cheese (provolone, mozzarella)
* 8 ounces sliced meat (salami, ham)
* 1 beaten egg yolk
* 1/2 tsp. garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp. dried oregano
* 1/2 tsp. dried parsley
* 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes

Heat oven to 375 and cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Roll out the pizza dough into a rectangular shape and layer with the selected Italian meats. Leave half an inch of dough showing around all ends. Then top the meat with the selected cheese(s). There's plenty of room for variation with a stromboli so select any favorites and play with the right number of slices of meat and cheese.

Finish off the stromboli by sprinkling the garlic powder, dried oregano, dried parsley and crushed red pepper flakes over top the cheese. Roll it up longways and pinch the ends closed. Place the rolled stromboli on a lined and greased baking sheet with the seam down. Use a basting brush to cover the stromboli with egg yolk. Sprinkle a little cheese on top and bake for 25-30 minutes until golden brown. Let stand a few minutes before slicing to serve.
