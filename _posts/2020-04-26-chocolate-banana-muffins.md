Time: 50 minutes;  Yields: 12 muffins

_Browning bananas, cocoa powder and chocolate chips combine for a tasty, healthyish muffin that satisfies a chocolate craving._

INGREDIENTS

* 2 cups whole wheat flour
* 2/3 cups unsweetened cocoa powder
* 1 1/2 tsp. baking soda
* 1 tsp. baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 3 large ripe bananas, mashed
* 3/4 cup milk
* 1/4 cup brown sugar, packed
* 1/3 cup honey
* 1/3 cup canola oil
* 2 large eggs (an egg replacer works well with this recipe!)
* 2 tsp. vanilla extract
* 1/2 cup chocolate chips, plus more for topping

Heat oven to 325. Grease a standard sized muffin pan and set aside.

In a large bowl, add whole wheat flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Whisk to combine and set aside.

In a medium bowl, add mashed bananas, milk, brown sugar, honey, oil, eggs and vanilla extract. Whisk to evenly combine.

Made an indent in the dry ingredients and pour wet ingredients into the large bowl. Use a wooden spoon to stir until just combined. When you start stirring, the batter may seem dry but keep stirring and you'll arrive at the right consistency. Stir in the 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.

Use a cookie scoop to evenly scoop the batter into the prepared muffin pan. Top with more chocolate chips if you please.

Bake at 325 for 22 to 25 minutes, using the toothpick test to make sure they're done. Once cooled, store in an airtight container.
