Hey there! My name is Chris and I've spent years of my adulthood scrolling through lengthy life narratives about how this one recipe reminds the blogger of a crisp autumn morning on Lake Erie when the extended family would gather for glorious meals around the farmhouse table while basking in the filtered light of the canopy of trees above...

all in an effort to get. the. delicious. recipe. 

So I decided to carve out a piece of the internet where my go-to recipes live. I hope you enjoy the recipes I love making and my family loves eating.
