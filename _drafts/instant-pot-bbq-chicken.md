_Easy Instant Pot (IP) recipe for tender BBQ chicken! Perfect for shredded BBQ chicken sandwiches or tasty BBQ chicken appetizers._

INGREDIENTS

* 1 Tbsp. olive oil
* 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts
* 1/2 cup water
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1 tsp. garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp. black pepper
* 1 cup favorite BBQ sauce + more for serving

Add olive oil and chicken to the IP inner pot. Pour in water and sprinkle chicken with seasoning. Pour BBQ sauce over top the chicken so that it's well covered and sitting on top of the chicken. This will help avoid a Burn notice, every IP users least favorite thing.

Place the lid on the IP and make sure the float valve is set to closed. Select Manual Pressure and program for 10 minutes. When the timer beeps, let the pressure naturally release for 10 minutes and then do a Quick Release for any remaining pressure.

To quickly shred it your BBQ chicken, use a handheld mixer on low setting. This is a bit messy but gets the job done quickly. Or you can shred by hand the chicken will fall apart easily for you. 

Serve the shredded BBQ chicken on broiche buns or homemade sandwich rolls. Or you could really place over top your favorite carb (baked potatoes, french fries, tater tots, nachos)!
