_This recipe is stuffed peppers in easy mode with help from an Instant Pot. Brown the meat, dump in the other ingredients and seal it up. Hearty weeknight dinner with leftovers ;)_

INGREDIENTS

* 1 Tbsp. olive oil
* 1 lb ground turkey
* 1/2 onion, diced
* 2 bell peppers, diced
* 1/2 tsp minced garlic
* 1 4 oz can chiles diced
* 1 15 oz can quality spaghetti sauce
* 1 15 oz can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
* 1 1/2 cups white rice, uncooked
* 2 cups beef broth
* 1 tsp. chili powder
* 1 tsp. salt
* 1 cup freshly shredded mozzarella

Set your Instant Pot to saute. Add the olive oil and then the ground turkey. Brown for a few minutes then add in the diced peppers, garlic and onion, until softened. 

Turn the IP off. Leave ground turkey at the bottom of the pot and pour over top it the diced chiles, spaghetti sauce, fire-roasted tomatoes, white rice, beef broth, chili powder, and salt. Don't stir. Just close the lid. The broth should have all the rice and everything else covered.

Set the gasket to seal and program the IP to Manual Low Pressure for 10 minutes. Allow a 5 minute Natural Release and then do a Quick Release to remove to any remaining pressure.

Stir and serve topped with shredded mozzarella cheese.
