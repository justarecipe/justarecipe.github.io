_A classic three-layer marbled cake with swirls of chocolate and vanilla cake topped off with American buttercream frosting, and all egg-free!_

INGREDIENTS FOR CAKE

* 4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 4 1/2 tsp. baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. baking soda
* 3/4 tsp. salt
* 2 1/4 cup milk
* 2 1/4 Tbsp. apple vinegar
* 1 1/8 cups unsalted butter, softened 
* 2 1/4  cup sugar
* 3 tsp. vanilla
* 1/2 cup water
* 3/8 cup unsweetened cocoa powder

INGREDIENTS FOR BUTTERCREAM FROSTING

* 3 sticks unsalted butter, softened
* 6 cups powdered sugar
* 1.5 tsp. vanilla extract
* 3 Tbsp. whole milk
* 3/8 tsp. salt

**To make the cake,** prep three 8-inch round cake pans with parchment paper and baking spray (like [Pam Baking Spray](https://www.pamcookingspray.com/products/baking)) Set aside. Heat oven to 350.

In a large bowl, add the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Whisk together and set aside.

In a small mixing bowl, add the apple vinegar and milk. Set aside and allow the mixture to get to room temperature. The liquid should thicken and curdle, which is essential for the eggless cake to bake properly.

In a standing mixer, add the butter and sugar. Beat together on medium-high speed. Scrape down the bowl, add the vanilla, and continue beating. 

Slow the speed to low and add one third of the flour mixture. Mix well and stop the mixer to scrape down the bowl. Add half the milk mixture and continue mixing on low. Stop the mixer to scrape down the bowl. Add another third of the flour mixture and mix. Scrape down the bowl. Add the remaining milk mixture and mix on low. Stop and scrape down the bowl. Add the remaining flour mixture and mix until just combined. _There's ALOT of cake batter with this recipe so it's important at each interval to make sure the ingredients are getting fully mixed with no clumps at the bottom or on the sides of the bowl._

In a separate bowl, stir together hot water and unsweetened cocoa powder. Add about a third of the cake batter mix to the cocoa mixture. Fold in the cocoa completely to finish the chocolate cake batter. 

Gather the prepped cake pans and begin pouring the vanilla cake batter at the bottom, aiming for equal amounts in all three pans. Add a layer of chocolate cake mix. Add the remaining vanilla mix and top again with remaining chocolate. No need to swirl the different batters to create the marbled effect. 

Bake for 40 minutes or until the cakes pass the toothpick test. Let cakes cool for 10 minutes and then remove from the pans to cool completely. 

**To make the buttercream frosting**, add the butter to the mixer or bowl and beat on medium speed for 2 minutes, until creamy.

Add the powdered sugar a little at a time, making sure to not create a puff of powdered sugar and mix on a slow speed. Continuing with the slow speed, add the milk, salt and vanilla extract.

Once all the ingredients are added to the mixer or bowl, increase the mix speed to high and beat for 3 to 5 minutes.
