_An easy zucchini quick bread that's moist, eggless, and delicious. Mix in some mini chocolate chips for an extra treat!_

* 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 3/4 cup whole wheat flour
* 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. baking soda
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1/2 tsp. cinnamon
* 1/4 cup vegetable oil
* 1 cup zucchini, grated (probably one medium-sized zucchini)*
* 1/3 cup white sugar
* 1/3 cup brown sugar
* 1/2 cup plain yogurt (Greek works if in a pinch)
* 1/4 cup milk
* 1 tsp. vanilla
* 1/3 cup mini chocolate chips (plus more for topping, optional)

Heat oven to 350. Grease loaf pan with PAM Baking Spray and set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, add the flours, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. Whisk together and set aside.

In a medium mixing bowl, add the vegetable oil, grated zucchini, sugars, yogurt, milk and vanilla. Whisk together until fully incorporated.

Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Use a wooden spoon to mix together but be careful not to overmix. Fold in the chocolate chips and pour batter into the prepared bread loaf.

Bake 50 to 55 minutes (or until it passes the toothpick test). Let cool in the pan for 15 minutes and then place on a wire rack to cool. Store in an airtight container. 

\*In some zucchini bread recipes, you'll see a note to soak up some of the vegetable's liquid. That's not necessary here so grate and go!
