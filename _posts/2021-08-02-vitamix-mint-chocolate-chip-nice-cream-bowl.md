Time: 5 minutes; Yields 2 servings

_A tasty, creamy, frozen treat featuring fresh mint and chocolate chips that'll satisfy a sweet tooth._

INGREDIENTS

* 6-8 fresh mint leaves
* 1 cup frozen or fresh spinach
* 2/3 cup oatmilk
* 2 Tbsp. sunbutter
* 2 frozen bananas
* 1 tsp. vanilla extract
* chocolate chips for topping

In a Vitamix or high-powered blender, add the mint, spinach, oatmilk, sunbutter, bananas and vanilla extract. (It helps to place the heavier, frozen items on top of lighter ingredients to weigh them down and get the blender moving faster.) Secure the lid and start the blender on low, quickly ramping up to high. Tamp ingredients if needed and remove once desired consistency is reached.

Scrape into bowls and top with chocolate chips.
