Time: 50 minutes; Yields: 2 dozen cookies

The best eggless chocolate chips ever baked! 

2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

1/2 tsp. baking soda

1/2 tsp. baking powder

1 tsp. salt

2 sticks unsalted butter, softened

3/4 cup sugar

3/4 cup dark brown sugar

1 oz. cream cheese, softened

1 Tbsp. whole milk

1 tsp. vanilla extract

2 cups chocolate chips

Heat oven to 350. Line cookie sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.

In a large bowl, add the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Whisk and set aside.

In a standing mixer bowl, add the butter and sugars. Beat on medium speed until smooth. Add cream cheese and milk. Beat until smooth and creamy. Scrape down the sides of the bowl to ensure a consistent dough. (Nerd out about the science of scraping your bowl here from [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/cookie-science-the-importance-of-scraping-your-bowl).) Add vanilla extract and mix again.

Add the dry ingredients to the mixing bowl, one spoonful at a time while the mixer is on low.
