Time: 1 hour; Makes 3-4 servings

_This recipe is a tasty vegetarian meal but the veggie prep takes a bit of time. Real talk: The first time I made this it took me 1 hour 30 minutes from washing off the broccoli to getting it on the dinner plate. But delicious._

INGREDIENTS FOR ROASTED MUSHROOMS

* 16 ounces baby bella mushrooms
* 1 Tbsp. high heat oil, like avocado or canola oil
* 1 Tbsp. rice wine vinegar
* 2 Tbsp. honey
* 2 Tbsp. soy sauce (reduced sodium)
* 1/2 tsp. grated ginger

  INGREDIENTS FOR NOODLES & VEGGIES
* 2 bundles of soba noodles
* 1 Tbsp. olive oil
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2 shallot, diced
* 1 head broccoli florets, cut in bite size pieces
* 5 stalks kale, cut into shreds

  INGREDIENTS FOR SOBA NOODLE SAUCE
* 1/4 cup soy sauce (reduced sodium)
* 2 Tbsp. olive oil
* Juice of 1 lemon
* 1 Tbsp. toasted sesame oil
* 1 Tbsp. honey
* 1 tsp. sriracha
* 1/2 tsp. grated ginger
* sesame seeds, for garnish

To prepare the roasted mushrooms, heat oven to 425 and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove stems from mushrooms, wipe any dirt off with a paper towel or soft cloth and slice each mushroom in half. Place mushrooms in a large bowl.

Whisk together high-heat oil, rice wine vinegar, honey, soy sauce and grated ginger. Pour glaze over this mushrooms and mix until evenly coated. Place mushrooms on the lined baking sheet and roast for 15 minutes. Remove sheet from the oven and toss the mushrooms to ensure even cooking. Roast for another 15 minutes and set aside.

While the mushrooms are roasting, whisk together the soba noodle sauce ingredients - soy sauce, olive oil, lemon juice, toasted sesame oil, honey, sriracha and grated ginger. Set aside.

Then cook soba noodles according to package directions. Separately heat a large skillet with 1 Tbsp. olive oil over medium heat. Add minced garlic and diced shallot and cook for 1 minute. Add broccoli and kale (and salt and pepper to taste). Cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add cooked soba noodles to the pan of broccoli and kale. Pour in the soba noodle sauce and stir until evenly coated.

Plate the noodles and veggies, and top with the roasted mushrooms. Garnish with sesame seeds.
