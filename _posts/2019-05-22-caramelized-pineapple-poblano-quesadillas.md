_Tasty, feels-like-summertime quesadillas! This quick recipe incorporates fresh pineapple, poblanos and freshly shredded Monterey Jack cheese._

INGREDIENTS

* 2 cups fresh pineapple, diced into bite-sized pieces
* 3 Tbsp. coconut oil
* 1/8 tsp. cinnamon
* 1/8 tsp. salt
* 1 poblano pepper, seeded and diced
* 1/2 sweet onion, diced
* 6 ounces Monterey Jack, freshly shredded
* 4 flour tortillas

Heat skillet over medium heat and add one Tbsp. oil. Add pineapple, cinnamon and salt to the skillet. Heat, stirring occasionally, for 6 to 8 minutes. Remove pineapple from skillet and set aside.

Add one Tbsp. oil to the skillet and add poblano and onion. Heat for 3 minutes or until peppers and onions soften. Remove from skillet and set aside.

Reduce skillet heat to low. Add a bit of coconut oil and place the tortilla on the skillet. Sprinkle one half of the tortilla with cheese and top with pineapple, peppers and onion. Fold in half. Gently flip the loaded quesadilla after a few minutes or once it appears golden brown. Cook until other side is golden brown and serve with sour cream or a sweet salsa.

Optional: If you have shredded rotisserie chicken on hand, you can add meat to the quesadilla when you're assembling it. Just an optional extra boost of protein.
