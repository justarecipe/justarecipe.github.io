_An easy vanilla cupcake recipe that comes together quickly and delivers a classic, tasty cupcake._

INGREDIENTS

* 1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 4 Tbsp. water*
* 4 tsp. egg replacer like [Namaste Egg Replacer](https://namastefoods.com/products/gluten-free-egg-replacer?variant=29452022939766&currency=USD&gclid=Cj0KCQiArdLvBRCrARIsAGhB_sxCT5d6MLfn89SSTIjGl3SmGCfXaZiK8J7wZq_jY_RFjgUBu7faHboaAgjAEALw_wcB)*
* 2/3 cup white sugar
* 1 1/2 sticks sticks butter, melted
* 2 tsp. vanilla extract
* 1/2 cup milk

Heat oven to 350. Place cupcake liners in a cupcake pan and set aside.

In a separate large bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt. Whisk ingredients until well combined.

Using a mixing stand and paddle attachment, add the water and egg replacer to the mixing stand bowl and beat until combined. Add sugar and beat for two minutes until creamy. Slowly add the melted butter and vanilla extract and continue to mix. 

Once incorporated, add half the flour mixture to the mixing stand as it slows mixes. Then add all the milk. Then continue with the rest of the flour mixture. Mix until just combined, being careful not to overmix.

Evenly pour the cupcake batter into the 12 cupcake liners. Bake for 18 minutes and do a toothpick test to make sure they're done. Let cool and then frost with a favorite buttercream, like this [Chocolate Buttercream Frosting](https://justarecipe.github.io/chocolate-buttercream-frosting/).
