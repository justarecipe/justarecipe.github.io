_A tasty take on the black bean burger with a little spice! This recipe doesn't require a food processor. Just bake, smash, mix, season and form into delicious patties for an easy weeknight meal._ 

INGREDIENTS

* 1 15 oz. can black beans, rinsed, drained, and patted dry
* 1/2 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
* 1/3 cup bell pepper, small diced
* 1/2 cup yellow onion, small diced
* 1/2 Tbsp. garlic, minced
* 1 tsp. cumin
* 1/2 tsp. chili powder
* 1/8 tsp. smoked paprika
* 1/4 cup breadcrumbs
* 1 egg (or egg replacer equivalent)
* 1/2 Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
* 1 Tbsp. BBQ sauce
* salt & pepper to taste
* hamburger buns of your liking
* toppings of your liking including cheddar, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mayo, pickles, gaucamole, chipotle mayo, caramelized onions, etc. 

Heat oven to 325. Place black beans on a rimmed baking sheet and spread evenly. Bake for 15 minutes to remove moisture and help with the texture of the burgers.

While black beans are burning off moisture, place a skillet over medium heat. Add olive oil, then add bell pepper, onion and garlic. Saute for 6 minutes, until onion begins to soften. Once softened, add to a large bowl. 

In the large bowl, add the spices -- cumin, chili powder, smoked paprika. Add the breadcrumbs, egg, Worcestershire sauce, and BBQ sauce. Mix together and set aside, adding salt and pepper as you see fit.

Remove black beans from the oven and use a fork to smash the beans. Allow some beans to keep a little shape. Add smashed beans to the large bowl and thoroughly mix with the spices, breadcrumbs, egg and vegetables. Then divide black bean mixture into four parts and form into circular patties. 

Increase oven heat to 375. Line a baking pan with parchment paper and spray with [coconut oil](https://www.amazon.com/PAM-Coconut-Oil-No-Stick-Spray/dp/B00K6ZK342) to prevent any sticking. Place the patties on the pan and bake for 10 minutes. Remove from oven and flip. Bake for another 10 minutes.

Remove from oven and complete the black bean burgers with buns, cheese and your favorite toppings. Keep it classic or go fancy and enjoy!
