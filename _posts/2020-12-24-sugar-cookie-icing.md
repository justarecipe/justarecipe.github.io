Time: 5 minutes Yields: Enough for 2 dozen cookies

_Perfect and simple icing recipe for cut-out cookies (_[_recipe HERE_](https://justarecipe.github.io/eggless-sugar-cookies/)_)._

INGREDIENTS

* 2 cups powdered sugar
* 2 Tbsp. milk
* 1 1/2 Tbsp. light corn syrup
* 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract

In a standing mixing bowl, add the four ingredients and whisk together until reaching an even consistency. If using food coloring, divide icing into separate bowls and add food coloring dye. Mix together until a uniform color is reached and add more food coloring if desired.

Apply icing to sugar cookies by piping bag or small metal spatula. If applying via piping bag, you will need to add more milk for an easier experience. Let icing harden before storing.
