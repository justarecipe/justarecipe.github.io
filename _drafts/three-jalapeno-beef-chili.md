_Fresh jalapenos, ground beef and smoked paprika come together in a quick, one-pot chili with a small kick._

INGREDIENTS

* 1/2 Tbsp. olive oil
* 1  yellow onion, diced
* 2 jalapenos, seeded and diced
* 1 green pepper, diced
* 4 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 lb. ground beef
* 1 Tbsp. chili powder
* 1 Tbsp. cumin
* 1 tsp. smoked paprika
* 1/2 tsp. salt 
* 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper
* 7 oz. tomato sauce
* 14.5 oz. can fire roasted diced tomatoes
* 14 oz. can chicken broth
* 7 oz. black beans, rinsed
* 15 oz. can kidney beans, rinsed
* 1 jalapeno, sliced for topping
* sour cream, for topping

Place a large pot over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and then diced onion. Saute until transparent. Add the diced jalapenos, green pepper and garlic. Saute for a minute then add the ground beef. Cook beef and break into large pieces, then smaller pieces of uniform size, browning all the way through for about 7 to 10 minutes.

Once beef is browned, add the spices (chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, salt, cayenne pepper). Stir until spices coat the beef and pepper mixture. Then stir in the tomato sauce, fire roasted diced tomatoes, chicken broth, black beans and kidney beans. Let the chili come to a boil then lower heat to a simmer.

Simmer for 25 minutes, stirring often, over low heat. Top each bowl with sliced jalapenos and sour cream, if desired.
