_A summer produce meets lasagna overhaul! This white sauce lasagna is delicious and worth the wait but I wouldn't recommend as a weeknight dinner for those hungry NOW. With a bake time of 50 minutes and a decent amount of prep work, save this recipe for a tasty weekend meal!_

INGREDIENTS

2 poblanos

2 Tbsp. butter

2 cloves garlic, minced

1 cup corn kernels (thawed if frozen)

3/4 cup heavy cream

1/4 cup milk

1 tsp. thyme

salt and pepper to taste

1/2 cup thinly sliced yellow onion

1 large zucchini, diced

6 no-boil lasagna noodles

1 cup freshly shredded white cheddar (or mozzarella)

Heat broiler. Put poblano peppers on a baking sheet and broil for 5 minutes, turning as needed, until charred. If the stem of the poblano is long, remove before broiling as that thin piece may smoke as the pepper is charring to perfection. Remove peppers and place in a plastic bag and seal. This will help loosen the skins. Once cool to the touch, peel off the blackened skins. Cut into 1 inch pieces and set aside.

Heat oven to 350 degrees. Melt 1 Tbsp. butter in a medium heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add 1 clove of garlic and saute for 1 minute. Mix in the corn and saute for 5 minutes. Stir in the heavy cream, milk and thyme. Cook over medium low heat for 5 minutes as the flavors incorporate. Turn off heat and season with salt and pepper. Use an inversion blender to puree the sauce.

Heat other 1 Tbsp butter in a small heavy skillet over medium heat. Add onion and saute for 5 minutes. Add remaining garlic and cook for 1 minute. Mix in diced zucchini and poblanos. Cook for 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

With all your layers ready to go, begin assembling your lasagna. First add one fourth of the corn sauce to a 8x8 baking dish. Cover with two lasagna noodles. Then spread the poblano/zucchini mixture over top the noodles and cover with one fourth the cheese. Repeat layering, ending with vegetables and cheese on top. 

Bake for 45 to 50 minutes until golden brown and bubbling. Remove from oven and let stand 5 minutes before serving.
