_An Oreo twist on the classic white cupcake! Top it with a cookies & cream buttercream frosting and Oreo halves (or a mini Oreo) for an indulgent treat._

INGREDIENTS

* 1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 4 Tbsp. water*
* 4 tsp. egg replacer like [Namaste Egg Replacer](https://namastefoods.com/products/gluten-free-egg-replacer?variant=29452022939766&currency=USD&gclid=Cj0KCQiArdLvBRCrARIsAGhB_sxCT5d6MLfn89SSTIjGl3SmGCfXaZiK8J7wZq_jY_RFjgUBu7faHboaAgjAEALw_wcB)*
* 2/3 cup white sugar
* 1 1/2 sticks sticks butter, melted
* 2 tsp. vanilla extract
* 1/2 cup milk
* 8 Oreo cookies, crushed 
* 6 Oreo cookies, cut in half for topping (optional)

Heat oven to 350. Place cupcake liners in a cupcake pan and set aside.

In a separate large bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt. Whisk ingredients until well combined.

Using a mixing stand and paddle attachment, add the water and egg replacer to the mixing stand bowl and beat until combined. Add sugar and beat for two minutes until creamy. Slowly add the melted butter and vanilla extract and continue to mix.

Once incorporated, add half the flour mixture to the mixing stand as it slows mixes. Then add all the milk. Then continue with the rest of the flour mixture. Mix until just combined and then fold in the crushed Oreos.

Evenly pour the cupcake batter into the 12 cupcake liners. Bake for 18 minutes and do a toothpick test to make sure theyâ€™re done. Let cool and then top with a favorite frosting, like this Cookies & Cream Buttercream Frosting!

\*If your family and friends don't have egg allergies, you can use 2 eggs in place of the egg replacer and water.
