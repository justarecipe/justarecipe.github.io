_Tasty and indulgent eggless cupcakes with flavors of maple and marshmallow._

FOR THE CUPCAKE BATTER

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 1/2 tsp. baking powder
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 3/4 cup whole milk
* 1 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar
* 1 cup maple syrup, **room temperature**
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, **room temperature**
* 1 tsp. maple extract

MARSHMALLOW BUTTERCREAM

* 2 cups mini marshmallows
* 1 Tbsp. milk
* 1 cup butter, softened
* 1 tsp. vanilla
* 2 1/4 cup powdered sugar

Heat oven to 350. Lined the cupcake tray with liners and set aside.

In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. In a separate bowl, combine the milk and apple cider vinegar. Set both aside.

Using a stand mixer, add the butter to the bowl and beat on medium-high speed until creamy, about 3 minutes. Add the maple syrup and beat on high speed until well combined. The ingredients **need to be a room temperature to properly mix.** Scrape down the sides with a spatula. Add the maple extract and beat again until combined.

Turn stand mixer to low speed and add the flour mixture / milk in three batches. (Flour followed by milk, flour, milk, flour). Mix until just combined. Avoid overmixing. Divide batter evenly into the 12 prepared cupcake liners.

Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, or until the toothpick comes out clean. Let cool on a wire rack while you prepare the Marshmallow Buttercream.

To make the Marshmallow Buttercream, heat a small saucepan over medium heat. Add marshmallows and milk, stirring often, until the marshmallows are completely melted and the marshmallow cream is uniform. Remove from heat and let cool, about 10 to 15 minutes. 

Using a stand mixer, add the butter to the bowl and beat on medium-high speed. Scrape in the marshmallow cream and add the vanilla extract. Beat together on high speed, about 2 minutes. Scrape down as needed. 

Slowly add in the powdered sugar and then increase the speed to medium-high for a minute. Place marshmallow buttercream in pastry bags and use your favorite decorating tips to top the cooled cupcakes.

**BONUS**: I added some white chocolate cupcake toppers. To make these, melt together about 4 ounces of white melting chocolate as directed on the packaging. While the chocolate is melting, prepare a clean, flat workspace with a sheet of parchment paper. Once the chocolate is melted, stir in 1/2 tsp. maple extract. Mix together by hand and transfer to a pastry bag or specialty squeeze bottle. Cut a small tip at the bottom of the pastry bag. Use the tip to create seasonal shapes — like snowflakes or Christmas trees — or whatever shape you desire.

Place the chocolate shapes in the fridge to cool and harden, about 10 to 20 minutes. Place the finished shapes atop the frosted cupcakes.
