Zucchini, oats, cinnamon and brown sugar bake up into moist, tasty muffins!

INGREDIENTS

* 1 cup of grated zucchini, do not worry about excess moisture from the zucchini
* 1/2 cup dark brown sugar
* 1/3 cup white sugar
* 1/3 cup vegetable oil
* 2 eggs*
* 1 tsp. vanilla extract
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup old-fashioned oats, plus more for topping
* 1/2 tsp. baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. baking soda
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1 tsp. cinnamon

Heat oven to 350. Line 12-muffin tray with liners and set aside.

In a medium bowl, add the zucchini, sugars, oil, eggs and vanilla. Whisk ingredients together until incorporated and set aside.

In a large bowl, add the flour, oats, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. Whisk together until incorporated.

Add the wet ingredients to the dry and stir well until combined. Scoop the batter into the prepared muffin tray, making sure to keep the batter amounts equal across the 12 holes. Top with a few more oats if desired.

Bake at 350 for 20-22 minutes or until it passes the toothpick test. Let cool in the pan and then let cool completely on a wire tray. Enjoy and store in an airtight container for a few days.
