_An easy muffin recipe that balances banana and pumpkin flavors with some brown sugar sweetness. This recipe doesn't require a mixer or eggs, and it results in tasty muffins within 30 minutes or so._

INGREDIENTS

* 2 very ripe bananas, mashed
* 1/2 cup pumpkin puree
* 1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
* 1/2 tsp. baking powder
* 1 tsp. baking soda
* 1 tsp. cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp. nutmeg
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1/3 cup vegetable oil
* 1 tsp. vanilla extract
* 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour

Heat oven to 375. Line muffin pan with muffin liners or spray with PAM Baking Spray with Flour and set aside.

Combine mashed bananas, pumpkin puree and brown sugar in a large bowl. Mix to combine.

Add baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt. Mix to combine. Then stir in the vegetable oil and vanilla extract. Mix until well incorporated.

Finally add the flour and gently fold the flour into the batter. Mix until just combined and be sure not to over mix, which could affect the texture of the muffin. The batter should be thick.

Scoop batter into lined or greased muffin pan and evenly distribute. Bake for 18 minutes and test the muffins with a toothpick to confirm they're done.

Let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Once cooled, store in an airtight container.
