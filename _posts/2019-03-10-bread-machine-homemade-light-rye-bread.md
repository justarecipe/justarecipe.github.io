Time: 3 hours 30 minutes; Makes one loaf

_This recipe is an easy introduction to a bread machine and makes great sandwich rye bread._

INGREDIENTS

1 1/2 cups water

4 1/4 cups bread flour

2/3 cup rye flour

2 Tbsp. sugar

1 1/2 tsp. salt

2 Tbsp. unsalted butter

1 Tbsp. caraway seed

2 tsp. active dry yeast*

For this recipe, I use the [Zojirushi Breadmaker Model BB-PAC20](https://www.amazon.com/Zojirushi-BB-PAC20BA-BB-PAC20-Virtuoso-Breadmaker/dp/B0067MQM48/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=zojirushi+bread+machine+bbpac20&qid=1552254883&s=gateway&sr=8-3). Modify directions based on your bread machine type or model.

Remove the baking pan from the bread machine and attach the kneading blades. Measure your ingredients and place ingredients in the baking pan in the following order.

1. Water
2. Bread and rye flour
3. Sugar, salt, butter, caraway seed
4. Active dry yeast (make a depression in the middle of the flour)

When adding the yeast, be sure the yeast does not touch the water. If dry yeast comes into contact with the liquid, the dough may not rise sufficiently, resulting in a #breadfail.

After all the ingredients are placed in the baking pan, return the pan to the bread machine and make sure the lid is closed securely. Use the Select Course button to set the arrow to regular wheat** and press the Start button. The display will show the completion time. When the bread is done baking, the machine will beep. Remove the loaf any time after the completion beep using care as the bread machine and lid will be hot.

Let cool before storing.

\*can substitute 2 1/2 tsp. rapid rise yeast IF doing quick bake.

\**set arrow to quick wheat if using rapid rise yeast
