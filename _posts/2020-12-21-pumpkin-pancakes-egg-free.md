_Pumpkin pancakes that are light, fluffy, delicious and egg-free!_

INGREDIENTS

* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 2 Tbsp. sugar
* 2 tsp. baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1 cup milk
* 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil
* 1/4 cup pumpkin puree
* 1 tsp. vanilla
* 1/4 tsp. cinnamon (or pumpkin pie spice)

In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Add in milk, vegetable oil and pumpkin puree and mix until well incorporated. Then add in vanilla and cinnamon and stir in well.

Place a nonstick skillet on the stovetop over medium heat. Once warmed to the point that water will dance, add about 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter to the skillet. Cook until bubbles form and then flip. Cook on the second side for about 2 minutes. Continue making batches of pancakes until batter runs out. Serve immediately with maple syrup.
