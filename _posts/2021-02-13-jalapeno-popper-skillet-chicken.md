_An appetizer-inspired meal that packs a punch with fresh jalapenos, moist chicken and melty, cheesy goodness all prepared in a cast iron skillet. Perfect served with white rice or mashed potatoes._ 

INGREDIENTS

* 2 large chicken breasts
* 1 Tbsp. olive oil
* 2 large fresh jalapenos, sliced with seeds removed
* 2 oz. cream cheese, softened
* 1/2 cup cheddar cheese, freshly shredded
* salt and pepper

Heat oven to 425. 

Cut each chicken breast in half. Then slice the chicken breast horizontally into two even pieces. If you're using two chicken breasts, you'll end up with eight pieces that are hopefully about equal in size. Season with salt and pepper.

Place the skillet over medium high heat. Add olive oil and once the oil starts to shimmer, add the chicken. Cook on each side, about 3 to 4 minutes, until reaching a golden sear. Depending on the size of your skillet, you may have to work in batches so the chicken isn't crowded. 

While the chicken cooks, add the fresh jalapenos, cream cheese and cheddar cheese to a medium bowl. Mix together and set aside.

Once the chicken is seared golden on both sides, remove the skillet from the heat. Add the cream cheese mixture over top the chicken and place the skillet in the oven. Bake for 8 minutes or until the cooking thermometer reads 165. Serve with white rice or mashed potatoes.
