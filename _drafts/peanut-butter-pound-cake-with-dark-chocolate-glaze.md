Ingredients for Pound Cake

* 2 1/2 sticks unsalted butter
* 2 cups granulated sugar
* 6 large eggs
* 2 tsp. vanilla extract
* 1/2 heaping cup creamy peanut butter
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp. baking powder
* 1/4 tsp. salt

Ingredients for Dark Chocolate Glaze

* 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar
* 2 Tbsp. cocoa powder
* 2 Tbsp. black cocoa powder ([like King Arthur Flour Black Cocoa](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/items/black-cocoa-12-oz))
* 1/4 cup milk
* 2 tsp. vanilla extract
* 3-4 fun size Butterfingers, crushed or chopped*

Heat oven to 350. Grease a 9 or 10-inch Bundt pan with a baking spray like PAM Baking Made with Flour. 

Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until just blended.

Add vanilla and slowly beat in peanut butter.

In a medium bowl, sift together flour with baking powder and salt. Then add the dry ingredients a little at a time to the butter mixture until well blended.

Spoon batter into prepared Bundt pan and bake for 45 minutes at 350. Then reduce setting to 325 and bake 15-20 minutes, until cake is done and passes toothpick test.

Cool cake in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Then remove cake from pan and let cake cool completely. 

For the glaze, sift together powdered sugar and cocoa powders in a medium bowl. Slowly stir in milk and vanilla, a little at a time, until glaze is smooth and pourable. Add more milk a few drips at a time if glaze is too thick. Spoon glaze over top cooled cake and finished with crushed Butterfingers.
