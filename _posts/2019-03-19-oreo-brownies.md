Time: 1 hour MAX; Makes 12-16 servings

_This recipe takes your typical box brownies and makes them a little more indulgent without too much hassle._

INGREDIENTS

* 1 box favorite brownie mix
* egg, as directed on box brownies
* vegetable oil, as directed on box brownies
* water, as directed on box brownies
* 12 Oreos, crushed or chopped

Heat oven to 350 and grease a baking pan (9x13 or 9x9 or 8x8). The smaller the pan size, the longer the bake time and the thicker the brownie.

Follow brownie box instructions and stir the brownie mix, egg, vegetable oil and water. Once your batter is well mixed, stir in half of your crushed Oreos. Spread the Oreo brownie batter in the greased pan and follow bake times for your pan.

Most boxes will dictate the following times: 

* 9x13 pan | 21-23 minutes 
* 9x9 pan | 28-31 minutes
* 8x8 pan | 30-33 minutes

Halfway through the bake time, remove your brownies from the oven. Sprinkle over top the remaining Oreos. Return the pan to the oven to finish baking.

Cool completely in pan on wire rack before cutting/serving.
