_A fun twist on the classic chocolate chip cookie that's also egg-free. With 36 cookies total, use chocolate buttercream frosting to decorate the cookies with ABC's and numbers 1-10. Note: This recipe uses a stand mixer and paddle attachment._ 

INGREDIENTS FOR THE COOKIES

* 2 1/4 cups whole wheat flour
* 1 tsp. salt
* 1 tsp. baking soda
* 1 cup butter, softened
* 3/4 cup brown sugar, packed
* 3/4 cup white sugar
* 1 tsp. vanilla extract
* 4 Tbsp. water
* 4 tsp. egg replacer like [Namaste Foods Egg Replacer](https://www.amazon.com/Namaste-Foods-Egg-Replacer-Ounce/dp/B016EMSCTS)
* 1 12 ounce bag semi-sweet chocolate chips

INGREDIENTS FOR THE CHOCOLATE BUTTERCREAM FROSTING

* 1 stick unsalted butter, room temperature
* 1 3/4 cup powdered sugar
* 1/4 cup cocoa powder
* 1 1/2 Tbsp. milk
* 1/8 tsp. salt
* 1 tsp. vanilla extract

DIRECTIONS FOR THE COOKIES

Heat oven to 375. Place parchment paper on a baking sheet and set aside.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt and baking soda. Set aside.

In a mixing stand, add the butter, brown sugar, white sugar and vanilla. Beat until creamy and scrape down the bowl as necessary.

In a small bowl, add the water and egg replacer. Mix together until well combined. Add the egg replacer mixture to the creamed sugar and butter. Beat together.

Add the flour mixture to the mixing stand bowl and mix well. Add chocolate chips and mix until combined.

Using a medium sized cookie scoop, drop cookie dough on the parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Bake for 8 minutes and let cool.

DIRECTIONS FOR THE BUTTERCREAM FROSTING

Add the butter to the mixer or bowl and beat on medium speed for 2 minutes, until creamy.

Add the powdered sugar a little at a time, making sure to not create a puff of powdered sugar and mix on a slow speed. Continuing with the slow speed, add the cocoa powder, milk, salt and vanilla extract.

Once all the ingredients are added to the mixer or bowl, increase the mix speed to high and beat for 3 to 5 minutes. Scrape buttercream frosting into an icing decorating bag and use an icing tip like #3, #55, #13 or #44.

Use the buttercream frosting to write the letters A-Z and numbers 1-10 on the three dozen cookies. Store in a tightly covered container.
