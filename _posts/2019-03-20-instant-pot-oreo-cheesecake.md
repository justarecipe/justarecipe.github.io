_This recipe is an easy introduction to using the Instant Pot for delicious cheesecakes._

INGREDIENTS

* 3/4 cup crushed Oreo cookies (or chocolate graham crackers)
* 2 Tbsp. melted butter
* 12 oz. cream cheese
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1/4 cup heavy cream
* 1/4 cup sour cream
* 1 tsp. vanilla extract
* 1 Tbsp. all-purpose flour
* 2 eggs, room temperature
* 1 egg yolk, room temperature
* 8 Oreos, coarsely chopped
* 1 cup water
* Chocolate sauce, whipped cream and 4 Oreos, for garnish

Coat the inside of a 7-inch springform pan with nonstick spray and line the bottom with parchment paper.

In a small bowl, combine the melted butter and crushed Oreos. Press evenly in the bottom of the springform pan. It's helpful to use the bottom of a measuring cup as a press. Place in the freezer for 10 minutes or until you've prepped the remainder of the ingredients.

In a mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese and sugar for one minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Then add the heavy cream, sour cream, vanilla and flour. Beat for one minute. 

Add the eggs and egg yolk to the cream cheese batter and beat until just combined. Be careful not to overmix the eggs. Fold in the 8 chopped Oreos.

Pour batter evenly into the prepared springform pan. Tap the pan on the counter several times to force any bubbles to the surface. Pop bubbles with a fork or toothpick.

Prepare the Instant Pot to "bake" the cheesecake. Add one cup of water to the Instant Pot and insert the steam rack. Carefully lower the springform pan onto the steam rack. I recommend creating an aluminum foil sling to lower and remove the pan with ease.

Place the lid on the IP and make sure the float valve is set to closed. Select Manual Pressure and program for 35 minutes. When the timer beeps, let the pressure naturally release for 10 minutes and then do a Quick Release for any remaining pressure.

Carefully remove the springform pan using your sling and place on a wire rack to cool. Use a paper towel to soak up any water on the top of the cheesecake. It's normal. The cheesecake is not ruined! 

Allow the cheesecake to cool to room temperature and then remove the sides of the pan. Peel back the parchment paper and cover the cheesecake. I use a small dessert carrier that firmly snaps closed like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/WIlton-Cake-Carrier-Server-Locking/dp/B000EN4FCM/ref=sr_1_23?keywords=dessert+carrier&qid=1553564596&s=gateway&sr=8-23). Refrigerate for four hours or overnight. 

Unwrap the parchment paper from the cheese and remove the springform bottom and parchment. Place the cheesecake on a serving plate and garnish with chocolate sauce, crushed or whole Oreos and whipped cream.
