_A tasty, eggless, charming twist on sugar cookies that's kid-friendly and perfect for St. Patrick's Day!_ 

INGREDIENTS

* 2 cups Lucky Charms marshmallows*
* 2 sticks butter, softened
* 1 1/4 cups sugar
* 1 oz. cream cheese, softened
* 1 Tbsp. sour cream
* 1 tsp. vanilla extract
* 1 tsp. cake batter extract
* 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/2 tsp. baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. baking soda
* 1/4 tsp. salt

Heat oven to 350. Line cookie sheet with parchment paper and set aside.

In a standing mixer, add butter and sugar. Cream together for 3 minutes. Scrape down sides of the bowl. Then add cream cheese, sour cream, vanilla and cake batter extracts and beat together until mixed. Scrape down sides of the bowl as needed.

Slowly add the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Mix until cookie dough is uniform. Fold in one cup of Lucky Charms marshmallows. 

Use a cookie scoop to correctly proportion out the cookies onto the baking sheet. Bake for 12 to 14 minutes or until the edges are set. Remove from the oven and quickly top with additional Lucky Charms marshmallows. Let the cookies remain on the hot sheet for 5 minutes and then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling. Store in an airtight container.
