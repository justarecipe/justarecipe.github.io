_Easy and quick Instant Pot (IP) recipe that creates tasty faux noodles using a nutrient-dense veggie -- spaghetti squash._

INGREDIENTS

* 1 midsize spaghetti squash
* 1 cup water
* 1 tsp olive oil
* salt and pepper to taste

Wash your spaghetti squash and slice in half lengthwise. The rind is thick so approach it as you would a watermelon of butternut squash and make sure your knife hasn't dulled.

Once halved, use a large spoon to remove the seeds. Rub olive oil over the flesh of the spaghetti squash and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Place the IP pot inside the IP base and fill with 1 cup water. Place IP cooking rack on the bottom of the pot and layer the spaghetti squash halves on top with the flesh facing upward.

Seal the Instant Pot and program to 6 minutes on High Pressure. Once the pressure has built up and the six minutes has eclipsed, the IP will beep. Do a Quick Release and remove the IP lid.

Remove the spaghetti squash halves and use a fork to create the faux noodles by scraping the flesh of the squash. Serve with your favorite sauce.
