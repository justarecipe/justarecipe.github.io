Time: 40 minutes; Yields: 12 muffins

_With whole wheat flour, antioxidant-packed blueberries and Greek yogurt, these muffins are a healthy-ish way to start the day and still tasty, too._

WET INGREDIENTS

* 4 Tbsp. warm water*
* 4 tsp. egg replacer (like [Namaste Foods Egg Replacer](https://www.amazon.com/Namaste-Foods-Egg-Replacer-Ounce/dp/B016EMSCTS))*
* 2/3 cup sweetened Greek yogurt (like Greek Gods Honey Greek Yogurt)
* 1/3 cup canola oil
* 1/4 cup milk
* 1/4 cup maple syrup
* 1 tsp. vanilla extract

DRY INGREDIENTS

* 2 cups whole wheat flour**
* 2 tsp. baking powder
* 1 tsp. cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 1 cup fresh blueberries
* white sparkling sugar (optional)

Heat oven to 350 and grease the muffin pan with Pam Baking Spray or something similar. Set aside.

In a large bowl, combine water and egg replacer. Stir until smooth. Then add sweetened Greek yogurt, oil, milk, maple syrup and vanilla. Whisk until incorporated.

In a medium bowl, whisk together wheat flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt. Once combined, carefully mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients bowl. Stir until just combined. Then add in fresh blueberries and stir again until evenly distributed.

Use an ice cream scoop to evenly fill the muffin pan with batter. If you choose, sprinkle the tops of the muffins with white sparkling sugar to give off that legit bakery vibe. Bake for 15-17 minutes or until it passes the toothpick test.

Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes and then remove the muffins to cool completely. 

\*if egg allergies arenâ€™t a concern, you can swap the egg replacer and water for 2 large eggs.

\**if whole wheat flour is too dense for your preferences, sub out for 1 cup all-purpose and 1 cup whole wheat flour.
