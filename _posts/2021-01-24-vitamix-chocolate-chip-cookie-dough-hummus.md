Time: 10 minutes

_A dessert-style hummus that brings on the sweet with notes of brown sugar and vanilla. Serve with apple slices or graham crackers._

* 1 15 oz. can garbanzo beans, rinsed and drained
* 1/3 cup sunbutter
* 1/4 cup dark brown sugar
* 1 Tbsp. milk
* 2 tsp. vanilla
* 1 pinch salt
* 1/3 cup mini chocolate chips

Place the garbanzo beans, sunbutter, brown sugar, milk, vanilla and salt in the Vitamix blender. Secure lid and start blending on low. Slowly increase speed to 10 and blend for 1 minute, until smooth. Use the tamper to push the ingredients into the blades, if necessary.

Once smooth, scrape the cookie dough hummus into a bowl. Add the mini chocolate chips and stir. Serve immediately. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for a few days.
