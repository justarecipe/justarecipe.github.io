Time: 12 minutes; Yields: icing for 12 cupcakes

_A cookies & cream buttercream frosting that desperately belongs on white, chocolate or Oreo cupcakes (or cakes)!_

INGREDIENTS

* 2 sticks unsalted butter, room temperature
* 3 1/2 cups powdered sugar
* 3 Tbsp. milk
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 2 tsp. vanilla extract
* 4 Oreo cookies, finely crushed

This recipe requires using a stand mixer and paddle attachment or a large bowl and electric beater. Add the butter to the mixer or bowl and beat on medium speed for 2 minutes, until creamy.

Add the powdered sugar a little at a time, making sure to not create a puff of powdered sugar and mix on a slow speed. Continuing with the slow speed, add the milk, salt and vanilla extract. Mix in the finely crushed Oreo cookies.

Once all the ingredients are added to the mixer or bowl, increase the mix speed to high and beat for 3 to 5 minutes. Pipe onto cupcakes or cakes as needed!
