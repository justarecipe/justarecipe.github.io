Hey there! My name is Chris, and I've spent years of my adulthood scrolling through paragraph after paragraph just to get to a recipe I pinned six weeks ago. With my index finger tired of scrolling, I decided to carve out a piece of the internet where my go-to recipes live.

I hope you enjoy the recipes I hit up frequently. And here you'll never need to scroll past a long story ;)

P.S. Want to see a recipe you love on here? Send me an email with the recipe to try out and we'll make it happen.
