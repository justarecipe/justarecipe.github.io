Time: 15 minutes; Yields: 2 dozen mini brownie bites

A protein pick-me-up that delights with cocoa powder, brown sugar and mini chocolate chips.

INGREDIENTS

* 3/4 cup sunbutter
* 3 Tbsp. dark cocoa powder
* 4 Tbsp. dark brown sugar
* 1 Tbsp. coconut flour
* 1 tsp. vanilla extract
* 1/3 mini chocolate chips, plus more for topping if desired

In a standing mixer, add the sunbutter and cocoa powder. Cream together until smooth. Add in the brown sugar, coconut flour, vanilla and mix until dough-like. Add in the chocolate chips and mix.

Meanwhile place parchment paper on a clean countertop or table. Remove bowl from the mixing stand and scrap brownie bite dough onto the parchment paper. Place another sheet of parchment paper over top the dough. Use a rolling pin and roll until it's an even 1/2 inch thick. Remove the top parchment paper. Use a dough cutter/scrape to cut small brownie squares. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 3 days.
