1 tsp. olive oil

1 large onion, diced

3 garlic cloves, minced

5 cups chicken broth

1 1/2 pound boneless chicken breast

6 strips bacon

3 medium carrots, diced

3 celery ribs, diced

2 tsp. dried basil

1 bay leaf

1 tsp. dried oregano

1 tsp. dried parsley

1 tsp. salt

1 tsp. black pepper

3 Tbsp. cornstarch

3 Tbsp. water

1 cup whole milk (or half & half), warmed

1 lb. gnocchi

4 kale leaves

1/2 cup Parmesan cheese

Heat oven to 400 degrees and line a baking sheet with oil. Lay bacon in a single layer on the sheet. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until crispy. 

While the bacon is in the oven, turn the Instant Pot (IP) to saute and heat olive oil for a few minutes. Add onion and stir. Add in minced garlic. Cook the onions until translucent. Pour in chicken broth and stir. Then add chicken, carrots, celery, basil, bay leaf, oregano, parsley, salt and pepper. 

Cover the IP and make sure the float valve is set to closed. Use the manual setting on high pressure and set the timer for 10 minutes. When the timer beeps, allow the IP to sit for 10 minutes and then release any remaining pressure by moving the valve to venting.
