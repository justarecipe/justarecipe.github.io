_An allergy-friendly take on no-bake energy balls that mixes sunflower butter with oats and chocolate chips._

INGREDIENTS

* 2 cups old-fashioned oats*
* 1 1/4 cups sunflower butter
* 1/4 cup honey
* 1/2 to 1 cup mini chocolate chips (your preference, chocolate lovers)*
* 2 Tbsp. chia seeds*

Combine all ingredients in a large bowl or mixer. Beat on low until well mixed. Roll mixture into balls. Depending on your preference, you can do smaller bite-size amounts or make each ball a bit larger. Store in an airtight container and refrigerate for 3 to 5 days.

\*If you're dealing with allergies, you'll need to check the packaging of your other ingredients (like the oats, chocolate and chia seeds) to make sure it's not processed at a facility that processes peanuts or tree nuts.
