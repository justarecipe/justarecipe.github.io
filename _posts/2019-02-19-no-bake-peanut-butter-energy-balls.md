_Time: 10 minutes_

INGREDIENTS

* 2 cups old-fashioned oats
* 1 1/3 cup creamy peanut butter
* 1/2 cup ground flax seed
* 1/4 cup honey
* 1 cup chocolate chips
* optional: 1-2 tbsp chia seeds

Combine all ingredients in a large bowl or mixer. Beat on low until well mixed. Roll mixture into balls. Depending on your preference, you can do smaller bite-size amounts or make each ball larger. Place on a baking sheet or directly into an airtight container.
