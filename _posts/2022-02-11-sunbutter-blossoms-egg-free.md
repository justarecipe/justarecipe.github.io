_An allergy-friendly take on Peanut Butter Blossoms! Sunbutter replaces peanut butter and cream cheese subs for eggs to create a tasty cookie topped with the classic Hershey kiss._

INGREDIENTS

* 1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 1/2 tsp. baking soda
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 1 stick unsalted butter, softened
* 1 oz. cream cheese, softened
* 1/2 Tbsp. milk
* 1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
* 1/4 cup white sugar
* 3/4 cup sunbutter
* 1 tsp. vanilla
* 24 Hershey's chocolate kiss, unwrapped*
* white sugar or colored sanding sugar for coating

In a medium bowl, add the flour, baking soda and salt. Whisk together and set aside.

In a standing mixer bowl, add the butter. Beat on high speed for about a minute. Add the cream cheese and beat again on high speed until combined. Add in the brown and white sugar to the mixing bowl. Beat on medium-high speed until combined. Scrape down sides of the bowl. Add the sunbutter and vanilla extract. Beat on high until combined.

Slowly add the flour mixture to the standing mixer bowl. Mix on low until just combined. Scrape the cookie dough into a plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. 

Once the 30 minute approaches, heat oven to 350. Prep two baking sheets with parchment paper. Pour sanding sugar(s) in a bowl(s). Use a cookie scoop to gather even amounts of dough and roll into a ball. Evenly roll the cookie dough balls in the sugar and place on the baking sheet. Bake for 10-11 minutes. 

Remove from oven and immediately top each cookie with a Hershey's kiss. Move the cookies to a cooling rack. Store in an airtight container.

\*If you are baking these cookies for someone with a nut allergy, be sure to triple check the Hershey's kiss bag for any allergen warnings.
