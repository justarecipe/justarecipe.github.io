_A tasty recipe to rescue those browning bananas with what else but chocolate chips!_

INGREDIENTS

* 3 overly ripe bananas
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 1/8 cup vegetable oil
* 1/8 cup milk
* 2 Tbsp. water*
* 2 tsp. egg replacer*
* 3/4 cup and 2 Tbsp flour
* 1/2 tsp. baking soda
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 1/2 tsp. cinnamon
* 1/2 cup chocolate chips, divided

Heat oven to 350. Grease an 8x8 pan and set aside.

Mash the bananas well and scrape into a large mixing bowl. Add brown sugar, oil and milk. Stir to combine. In a small bowl, whisk together the water and egg replacer. Add the egg replacer mix to the batter and stir to combine.

Add the dry ingredients (flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon) to the batter and mix until incorporated. Then stir in half the chocolate chips.

Pour the batter into the greased pan. Top with remaining chocolate chips. Bake 18-22 minutes or until the bars pass the toothpick test.

\*If no egg allergies, one egg can be substituted for the water/egg replacer.
