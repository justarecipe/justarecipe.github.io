_A tasty, kale salad topped with crispy chickpeas and freshly shredded Parmesan._

INGREDIENTS FOR ROASTED CHICKPEAS

* 1 15 oz. can garbanzo beans (chickpeas), drained and rinsed
* 1 Tbsp. olive oil
* 1/2 tsp. garlic powder
* 2 Tbsp. freshly shredded Parmesan
* salt and pepper, to taste

INGREDIENTS FOR SHREDDED KALE SALAD

* 1 bunch of fresh kale, stems removed and shredded into bite-size pieces
* 1 Tbsp. olive oil
* 2 Tbsp. lemon juice
* 1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce
* 1 Tbsp. Dijon mustard
* 1/4 tsp. garlic powder
* 3 Tbsp. freshly shredded Parmesan
* salt and pepper, to taste

Heat oven to 375 degree. Line baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.

Pat chickpeas dry and place in a small bowl. Add olive oil, garlic powder, Parmesan, salt and pepper, and mix until evenly coated. Place chickpeas on the lined baking sheet in a single layer. Bake 40 minutes, tossing halfway through until crispy.

In a medium bowl, add olive oil, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Whisk the dressing until well incorporated. In a large bowl, add the kale greens and dressing, using your fingers to massage the greens and dressing, adding a bit more dressing as you go so that it's coated to your liking.

Divide into two portions and top with roasted chickpeas and freshly shredded Parmesan. Serve immediately.
