_Fool-proof recipe for homemade pizza dough that uses the Zojirushi Bread Machine to do all the heavy lifting._

INGREDIENTS 

1 1/4 cup water

1 1/2 Tbsp. olive oil

3 3/4 cups bread flour

1 1/2 tsp. salt

1 1/2 Tbsp. sugar

2 tsp. rapid rise yeast

For this recipe, I use the [Zojirushi Breadmaker Model BB-PAC20](https://www.amazon.com/Zojirushi-BB-PAC20BA-BB-PAC20-Virtuoso-Breadmaker/dp/B0067MQM48/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=zojirushi+bread+machine+bbpac20&qid=1552254883&s=gateway&sr=8-3). Modify directions based on your bread machine type or model.

Remove the baking pan from the bread machine and attach the kneading blades. Measure your ingredients and place ingredients in the baking pan in the following order.

water

olive oil

bread flour

salt, sugar

yeast (make a depression in the middle of the flour)
