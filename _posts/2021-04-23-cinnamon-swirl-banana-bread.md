_Sweet cinnamon swirls delight in a moist banana quick bread!_

INGREDIENTS

* 2 sticks unsalted butter
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 2 eggs*
* 1 tsp. vanilla
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 cup whole wheat flour
* 1 tsp. baking soda
* 4 very ripe bananas, smashed
* 3 Tbsp. unsalted butter
* 3 Tbsp. brown sugar
* 2 Tbsp. ground cinnamon

Heat oven to 350. Grease a 9x5 baking loaf pan or line with parchment paper and set aside.

In a large microwave safe bowl, add butter. Heat butter in microwave until just melted. Add sugar and whisk together. Add eggs and vanilla and whisk until smooth.

Add flours and baking soda to the butter mixture. Use a wooden spoon to mix well. Then add in the smashed bananas. Fold in the bananas until fully incorporated. Set aside.

In a small microwave safe bowl, add butter. Heat in microwave until just melted. Then add the brown sugar and ground cinnamon and whisk together to create your cinnamon swirl mixture.

Pour 1/4 of the banana bread batter into the prepared baking loaf. Add 1/4 of cinnamon mixture. Use a table knife to swirl the cinnamon mixture into the batter. Add another 1/4 of batter and 1/4 of cinnamon mixture to the baking loaf pan. Swirl together and repeat this step for two more layers. 

Bake for 60 to 65 minutes or until it passes the toothpick test. Let the bread cool in the loaf for 30 minutes and then let finish cooling on a wire rack.
