_An easy, eggless sugar cookie recipe that's delicious and allergy-friendly, too!_ 

INGREDIENTS

* 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling out the cookie dough
* 2 tsp. baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature
* 1 cup sugar
* 2 Tbsp. sour cream
* 2 tsp. vanilla

Whisk the dry ingredients -- flour, baking powder and salt -- in a large bowl and set off to the side. 

In a mixing stand with a paddle attachment, beat butter and sugar for 4 minutes on medium-high speed until smooth and creamy. Then add in sour cream and vanilla and beat to combine.  

Turn mixer to a low speed and slowly add the flour mixture. Scrape the sides of the bowl as necessary. Mix until dough is combined and uniform. Divide cookie dough in two, and place each on a sheet of plastic wrap to cover. Place in the fridge for 30 minutes or so.

Once dough has been refrigerated, heat oven to 350. Place a sheet of parchment paper on a cookie sheet.

On a clean, dry working surface, sprinkle all-purpose flour. Place dough ball on the surface, and sprinkle flour on top and on the rolling pin. Slowly roll the dough into about 1/4 inch thickness. Use favorite cookie cutter shapes to create the cookies and carefully transfer to the cookie sheet.

Bake for 10 minutes, until edges are just turning golden on the edges. Remove cookies from the cookie sheet and transfer to a wire rack to cool. Continue using dough, gathering scraps and forming into a dough ball and re-rolling until all the dough is used. If the dough becomes too warm to work with, place back on a sheet of plastic wrap and return to the refrigerator. 

Eat as is or dipped in hazelnut spread or decorated with royal icing.
