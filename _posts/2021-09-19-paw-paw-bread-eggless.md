_A seasonal quick bread featuring paw paw fruit! This eggless quick bread recipe calls for_ [_America's best secret fruit_](https://www.seriouseats.com/what-are-pawpaws-wild-fruit-midwest-how-to-prep-and-eat-pawpaws)_, which might be available in your neck of the woods around September._

INGREDIENTS,

* 4-6 fresh, ripe paw paws, peeled with the large seeds removed and the pulp mashed (approximately 285 grams of paw paw puree)*
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
* 1/2 cup buttermilk
* 2 tsp. vanilla extract
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp. baking powder
* 3/4 tsp. baking soda
* 1/4 tsp. salt

Heat oven to 350. Line two mini bread pans with parchment paper and grease with a no-stick baking spray. Set aside.

In a medium bowl, mix together the paw paw pulp and the melted butter. Add in the buttermilk, vanilla and brown sugar. Mix until well combined.

Add in the remaining dry ingredients: flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Again mix well until well combined.

Scrape the quick bread batter into the two prepared mini bread pans. Bake at 350 for roughly 45 minutes or until it passes the toothpick test.

Let cool in pan for 10 minutes and continue cooling on a wire rack. Store covered at room temperature.

\* If you need to supplement the paw paw fruit, add in ripe, mashed banana to get to the right amount.
