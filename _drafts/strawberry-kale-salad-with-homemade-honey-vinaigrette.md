Time: 10 minutes; Yields 1 salad

_Quick and easy green salad topped with fresh fruit, feta and nuts, and completed with a whip-together-in-seconds homemade honey vinaigrette._

INGREDIENTS FOR SALAD

* 3-4 kale leaves
* 3-5 strawberries
* 1-2 Tbsp. crumbled feta cheese
* 1-2 Tbsp. candied nuts like walnuts or pecans

INGREDIENTS FOR DRESSING

* 1 Tbsp. good olive oil
* 1 Tbsp. honey
* 1/2 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar
* pinch of salt
* freshly ground pepper

Prepare kale leaves by washing thoroughly and cutting away the stem/rib of the leaf. Continue slicing the kale into bite-size ribbons. Set aside.

Slice strawberries by removing the stem and then cutting vertically from bottom to top. Place strawberries on top of kale. Finish off the kale salad with feta cheese and candied nuts.

Whip together a quick homemade vinaigrette by combining the olive, honey, apple cider vinegar, salt and pepper. Whisk in a bowl until well incorporated and drizzle over top the greens.

This specific salad serves one but the recipe is easily doubled or quadrupled. For the dressing, keep the ratio of vinegar to olive oil and honey as 1:2:2 and increase the salt and pepper amounts to your liking.
