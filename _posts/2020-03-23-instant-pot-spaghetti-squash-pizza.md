_Cheesy goodness and your favorite pizza toppings cover a perfectly cooked spaghetti squash that comes together quickly in the Instant Pot and broiler._

INGREDIENTS

* 1 midsize spaghetti squash
* 1 tsp. olive oil
* salt and pepper, to taste
* 1 cup water
* 1/2 cup to 1 cup favorite pizza sauce*
* 1 cup (or more) freshly shredded mozzarella*
* Favorite pizza toppings like pepperoni, banana peppers, olives or mushrooms

Wash your spaghetti squash and slice in half lengthwise. The rind is thick so approach it as you would a watermelon or butternut squash and make sure your knife hasnâ€™t dulled.

Once halved, use a large spoon to remove the seeds. Rub olive oil over the flesh of the spaghetti squash and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Place the IP pot inside the IP base and fill with 1 cup water. Place IP cooking rack on the bottom of the pot and layer the spaghetti squash halves on top with the flesh facing upward.

Seal the Instant Pot and program to 7 minutes on High Pressure. Once the pressure has built up and the countdown begins, turn on the broil function in your oven. After the seven minutes has eclipsed, the IP will beep. Do a Quick Release and remove the IP lid. 

Remove the spaghetti squash halves and place on a baking sheet. Twirl the spaghetti strands and top with pizza sauce, cheese and your favorite pizza toppings. Place baking sheet on the top rack of the oven and broil for 2 minutes, checking to make sure the cheese begins to bubble and brown without burning. 

Remove from oven and serve immediately. Use sturdy tongs to quickly transfer the hot spaghetti squash pizzas from baking sheet to plate. 

\*Use the preferred amount of sauce and cheese for your diners.
