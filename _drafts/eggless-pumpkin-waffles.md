_A quick and tasty eggless pumpkin waffle recipe that's moist, sweet and perfectly spiced for fall_ â€” _or any season!_

INGREDIENTS 

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2/3 cup sugar
* 3 tsp. baking powder
* 1 tsp. baking soda 
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1 tsp. cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp. nutmeg
* 1 cup milk
* 1 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar
* 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter
* 1 cup pumpkin puree
* 1 Tbsp. brown sugar
* 1 tsp. vanilla

Plug in and turn on the waffle iron to heat up. (This recipe uses a Cuisinart Belgian Waffle Maker.)

In a large bowl, add the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. Whisk to combine and set aside.

In a medium bowl, add the milk and apple cider vinegar. The two ingredients will curdle. Then add in the melted butter, pumpkin puree, brown sugar and vanilla. Whisk together until full incorporated.

Add the wet ingredients into the large bowl of dry ingredients. Fold them in until just combined, being careful not to overmix.

With the waffle iron hot and ready to use, grease with a cooking spray like PAM. Pour some the batter on the waffle iron, being sure not to overfill. Let cook until steam stops pouring out or until the waffle iron beeps to indicate it's done. Carefully remove and eat immediately!
