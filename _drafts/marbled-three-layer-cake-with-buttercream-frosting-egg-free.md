_A classic three-layer marbled cake with swirls of chocolate and vanilla cake topped off with American buttercream frosting, and all egg-free!_

INGREDIENTS FOR CAKE

* 4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 4 1/2 tsp. baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. baking soda
* 3/4 tsp. salt
* 2 1/4 cup milk
* 2 1/4 Tbsp. apple vinegar
* 1 1/8 cups unsalted butter
* 2 1/4  cup sugar
* 3 tsp. vanilla
* 1/2 cup water
* 3/8 cup unsweetened cocoa powder

INGREDIENTS FOR BUTTERCREAM FROSTING

* 3 sticks unsalted butter, softened
* 6 cups powdered sugar
* 1.5 tsp. vanilla extract
* 3 Tbsp. whole milk
* 3/8 tsp. salt

To make the cake, prep three 8-inch round cake pans with parchment paper and baking spray (like [Pam Baking Spray](https://www.pamcookingspray.com/products/baking)) Set aside. Heat oven to 350.

In a large bowl, add the flour

_This recipe was originally inspired by_ [_Mommy's Home Cooking_](https://mommyshomecooking.com/eggless-marble-cake/)_._

* Reduce speed to low and add half of the flour mixture. Scrape down the mixing bowl with a spatula and turn the batter over several times to ensure all of the ingredients are well incorporated. Add milk mixture; continue beating to incorporate. Add the remaining flour; beat just until combined. Do not overmix this batter. The batter will be slightly thick, and a few lumps are okay.
* Stir together hot water, cocoa and instant coffee powder (if using) until smooth and well combined.
* Take one-third of the vanilla batter and place it in a small bowl. Fold the cocoa mixture into the batter until blended.
* Spread a cup of vanilla batter in the bottom of the pan. Dollop on half of the chocolate batter, then repeat with another heaping cup of vanilla batter, the remainder of the chocolate, and top with the rest of the vanilla batter. NOTE: Thereâ€™s no need to swirl the batters together to get a marbled effect.
