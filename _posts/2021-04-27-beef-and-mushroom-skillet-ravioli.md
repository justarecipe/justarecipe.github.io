_An easy weeknight dish that whips up quickly in a cast iron skillet. Cheese ravioli, ground beef, sauteed mushrooms and fresh mozzarella combine for the perfect comfort food that's ready in under 40 minutes._

INGREDIENTS

* 20 oz. refrigerated or frozen four cheese ravioli
* 1/2 lb ground beef
* 4 oz. baby bella mushrooms, sliced
* 1 1/2 tsp. dried oregano
* 1/2 tsp. garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1/4 tsp. ground pepper
* 1 28 oz. can fire-roasted crushed tomatoes
* 4 oz. fresh mozzarella pearls

Heat broiler. Follow cheese ravioli directions on package and bring large pot of water to boil. Once the ravioli is cooked, drain and set aside.

As the water begins to boil, place a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Brown ground beef and crumble for about 5 minutes. Remove from pan and set aside.

Add mushrooms to the skillet and saute, stirring occasionally for about 8 minutes. If using 90/10 beef, add olive oil or butter to skillet with the mushrooms. Once the mushrooms are sauteed, add the ground beef back in to the pan. Season with oregano, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Add the crushed tomatoes and stir together. Carefully add in the cooked ravioli and half the fresh mozzarella pearls. Mix together and top with remaining mozzarella.

Broil for 2 to 3 minutes, until cheese begins to melt.
