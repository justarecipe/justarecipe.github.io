Time: 35 minutes; Makes 24 mini muffins

_This recipe is great for anyone trying baby-led weaning or serving toddlers who have egg allergies. Tasty enough to snack on as an adult, too._

* 1 cup plain yogurt
* 2 very ripe bananas
* 1/2 cup maple syrup
* 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. baking soda
* 1/4 tsp. cinnamon
* 3 cups oat (quick or rolled)

Heat oven to 400 degrees and spray the mini muffin pan with a non-stick baking spray like PAM Baking Spray with Flour.

Place the yogurt, bananas, maple syrup, baking powder, baking soda and cinnamon in a blender and blend together. Then add 1/2 cup of oats at a time to the blender. Stop the blend to stir/scrape down if necessary. Blend until well incorporated.

Divide batter among the 24 mini muffin cups and bake for 20 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean.
