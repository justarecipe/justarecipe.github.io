_A delicious and easy take on Ratatouille that's teaming with summer end-of-season vegetables and topped with cheesy baguette slices._

INGREDIENTS

3 Tbsp. olive oil

1 large onion, diced

4 garlic cloves, smashed

2 tsp. of herbes de Provence

1 tsp. salt

1 small eggplant, diced

1 small zucchini, diced

1 yellow or orange pepper, diced

1 28 oz. can whole San Marzano tomatoes, crushed

2 cups low sodium vegetable broth

large handful of fresh basil, torn

1 baguette, sliced 

Swiss or gruyere cheese

Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic. Stir and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Add 2 tsp. herbes de Provence and salt and stir. Then add the eggplant, zucchini, and peppers. Cook and stir for 5 minutes. Then add the tomatoes, broth and half the basil. Bring soup to a boil and reduce the heat. Simmer uncovered for 20 minutes. 

Heat the broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place the baguette slices on the sheet. Add cheese to the baguette slices. Place in the broiler for 1 minute and watch closely so that you can remove as soon as the cheese starts to melt.

Use an immersion blender to puree some of the soup, leaving some vegetables undisturbed for texture. Season with salt and fresh pepper, if desired. Serve soup topped with freshly torn basil leaves and cheesy baguette slices.
