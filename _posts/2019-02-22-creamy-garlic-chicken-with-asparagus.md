time: 50 minutes; Makes 4 servings

* 1 lb chicken breast or thigh
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt

  FOR SAUCE
* 8 ounces half & half
* 4 ounces milk
* 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 2 tablespoons butter, melted
* 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
* 2/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 5 cloves of garlic, minced
* 1 teaspoon olive oil
* 1 pound fresh asparagus with the bottoms trimmed and cut into 3-inch strips

Heat olive oil in a deep nonstick skillet over medium heat. Season chicken with pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and salt. If the chicken breasts are quite large, cut them into smaller pieces of equal size to allow for more even cooking.

Place chicken in the hot skillet and cook for 15-20 minutes, flipping as needed, until cooked thoroughly and golden brown on both sides. Chicken should read at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit on a meat thermometer. Remove chicken and set aside while you prepare the sauce.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the half & half, milk, melted butter, flour, crushed red pepper, Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper.

In the same skillet used to cook the chicken, add the minced garlic and olive oil. Cook over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes and then pour in the sauce mixture. Heat the sauce for 3 minutes and bring to a boil, stirring continuously.

Reduce heat to low and add asparagus and chicken to the skillet. Simmer until asparagus is tender, about 10 minutes, covered.
