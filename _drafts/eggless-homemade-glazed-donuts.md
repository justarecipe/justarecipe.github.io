Time: 4 hours; Yields: 12 donuts plus donut holes

These homemade donuts use a few vegan tricks - aquafaba and ground flaxseed - to fry up the perfect eggless donut.

INGREDIENTS FOR DONUTS

* 6 Tbsp. aquafaba (water from a chickpea can)
* 2 Tbsp. ground flaxseed
* 6 Tbsp. water
* 5 oz. milk
* 2 oz. coconut oil, melted
* 16 oz (454 g) bread flour*
* 2 oz. sugar
* 1 tsp. salt
* 1 1/2 tsp. quick-rise yeast
* oil for frying (I use vegetable oil)

INGREDIENTS FOR GLAZE

* 1 cup powdered sugar
* 2 Tbsp. milk
* 1/2 tsp. vanilla

To make this recipe, I use the [Zojirushi Breadmaker Model BB-PAC20](https://www.amazon.com/Zojirushi-BB-PAC20BA-BB-PAC20-Virtuoso-Breadmaker/dp/B0067MQM48/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=zojirushi+bread+machine+bbpac20&qid=1552254883&s=gateway&sr=8-3). Modify directions based on your bread machine type or model.

Place wet ingredients (aquafaba, water, milk, coconut oil) in the baking pan of the bread machine. Add dry ingredients on top (bread flour, sugar, salt). Create an indentation for the yeast so that it does not come into contact with the water prematurely and add the yeast. Once the ingredients are in the baking pan, return the pan to the bread machine and make sure the lid is closed securely. Use the Select Course button to set the arrow to Quick Dough and press Start. The display will show the completion time for the dough.

Once the dough has doubled in size, remove it from the bread machine and place on a floured surface. Divide dough in half. Cover one half with a clean towel and roll out the other half on the floured surface to about a 1/2 inch thickness. Use a donut cutter to form your donuts and set on individual pieces of parchment paper (about 4x4") on a cookie sheet. Repeat this step until all the dough is used.

Place the donuts (and donut holes) in an oven to let them rise. Microwave water in a large glass Pyrex bowl and place alongside with the donuts in the ovens as they rise. (This steps helps to prevent the donuts from forming a skin.)

Once the donuts have doubled in size, start h

Whisk together powdered sugar, milk and vanilla. Once the glaze is smooth and the donuts cool, apply the glaze with pastry brush. Set on a wire rack to harden and save in an airtight container â€” or eat immediately!
