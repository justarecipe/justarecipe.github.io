Time: 10 minutes; Yields: 2 medium smoothies

An orange-creamsicle-inspired smoothie that combines fresh oranges and Greek yogurt for a sweet pick-me-up.

INGREDIENTS

* 2 fresh oranges
* 1 cup ice cubes
* 1/2 cup Greek vanilla or honey yogurt like Siggi's or Greek Gods
* 2 Tbsp. oatmilk
* 1 tsp. vanilla extract

Use a knife to cut away the orange peel, leaving only the fruit. Add all the ingredients to a Vitamix blender (or similarly high-powered mixer). Secure lid and start blending on low. Slowly increase speed to 10 and blend for 30 seconds or until the smoothie reaches a consistent texture.

Pour into two glasses and top with whipped cream, if desired.
