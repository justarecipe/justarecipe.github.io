_The perfect summertime pie with a tart and sweet filling and homemade graham cracker crust. Key Lime Pie purists, keep scrolling. We're using Persian limes here. #sorrynotsorry_

INGREDIENTS

* 9 whole graham crackers, finely crushed
* 4 Tbsp. butter, melted
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1/4 tsp. cinnamon
* pinch of salt
* 2 14 oz cans sweetened condensed milk
* 1/4 cup sour cream
* 3/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice (about 6-7 Persian limes)*
* 2 Tbsp. cornstarch
* 2 Tbsp. cold water
* Whipped cream, for topping

Heat oven to 350. In a medium bowl, combine the melted butter, crushed graham cracker, sugar, cinnamon and salt. In a 9-inch pie pan, add the graham cracker crust mixture. Use the bottom of a measuring cup to firmly press the crust to the bottom and sides of the pie pan. Bake for 9 minutes. Remove from oven to cool on the counter.

While the crust bakes, begin making the filling. In a small bowl, mix together the cornstarch and cold water. In a large bowl, add sweetened condensed milk and sour cream. Whisk until combined. Then add lime juice and cornstarch mixture. Mix until well blended and set aside for 5 minutes to allow the filling to thicken. 

If the baked crust is still too warm, pop it in the freezer for a few minutes while the filling rests. Then pour the filling into the cooled pie crust. Bake for 15 minutes at 350 or until barely set. Cool on a wire rack and then place in refrigerator with plastic wrap over top. Refrigerate overnight and serve with whipped cream. 

_*Persian limes are the standard lime available at most grocery stores in the U.S. Key lime aficionados probably have some opinions on using freshly squeezed Persian limes._
