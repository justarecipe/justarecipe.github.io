Time: 4 hours total; Yields 2 small Gingerbread houses

INGREDIENTS

* 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 1/2 cup sugar
* 2 tsp ground ginger
* 2 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp nutmeg
* 1/2 tsp cardamom
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 sticks unsalted butter, softened
* 1/2 cup molasses
* 4 Tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 1/3 cup water
* 1 cup sugar (for assembling the house in a sturdy fashion)
* [Royal Icing for decoration](https://justarecipe.github.io/sugar-cookie-icing/)

In a large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients (flour, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, salt). Set aside.

In a standing mixer, add the butter and sugar. Beat until combined. Add the molasses and ground flaxseed/water mixture. Beat until combined. 

Slowly add the dry ingredients to the standing mixer. Mix until uniform. Remove gingerbread dough and wrap in plastic wrap. Place in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to chill. 

Once dough is chilled, heat oven to 350. Lightly flour a clean, dry, flat working surface. Roll out the gingerbread dough until 1/4 inch thick. [Use the 3D-printed gingerbread cutouts linked here](https://www.printables.com/model/107290-pernikova-chaloupka-vykrajovatko) or cut our your own cardboard pieces for the house. For each gingerbread house, you will need two long walls (left and right), two short walls (the front and back), and two roof pieces. You can opt to include windows, too.

Carefully cut out the pieces of the gingerbread dough, lift and transfer to a parchment paper-lined cookie tray. Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes. You'll want to avoid a softer cookie for this bake to make a sturdier structure. Remove pieces from the oven and again recut the gingerbread cutouts to ensure uniform shapes with clean lines.

If you are using the 3D gingerbread house linked here, this recipe allows enough dough for two gingerbread houses (and some trees or gingerbread cookies, too).

Let pieces cool for 15 minutes before attempting to decorate or assemble. Follow the directions from [Food.com](https://www.food.com/recipe/melted-sugar-glue-for-candy-houses-442917) to melt white sugar that will be the "glue" for the gingerbread house. Decorate as you please and have fun!
