_Chewy and delicious pumpkin chocolate chip cookies that are also eggfree!_

INGREDIENTS

* 1 stick unsalted butter, softened
* 1 cup dark brown sugar
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1 tsp. vanilla
* 5 Tbsp. pumpkin puree
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1/2 tsp. baking soda
* 1/2 tsp. cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice*
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup whole wheat flour**
* 1 cup chocolate chips

Heat oven to 350. Prep baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.

In a mixing stand, combine butter and sugars until well mixed. Add vanilla and pumpkin puree and mix until uniform. Then add the dry ingredients (salt, baking soda, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and flours). Mix cookie dough until fully combined. Add chocolate chips and mix one final time.

Using a cookie dough scope to gather uniform amounts of dough, place cookie dough balls on the prepared parchment-paper-lined cookie sheet. Bake 14 to 16 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack. Top with more chocolate chips once baked if desired.

\*If you LOVE the taste of pumpkin pie spice, you can double the amount to a half teaspoon.

\** If wheat flour isn't available, you can substitute all-purpose flour. Whole wheat flour adds a bit more nutrition.
