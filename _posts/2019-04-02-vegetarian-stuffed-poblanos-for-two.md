Time: 45 minutes; Makes 3 servings

_Tasty poblanos with rice, black beans and melted cheese combine for a delicious vegetarian dinner._

INGREDIENTS

* 3 poblanos, sliced lengthwise with seeds discarded
* 1 cup uncooked rice
* 1 15 oz. can black beans, drained and rinsed
* 1 cup frozen corn
* 1 cup fresh salsa (or fire-roasted tomatoes, in a pinch)
* 1 Tbsp. cumin
* 1 Tbsp. chili powder
* 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese (white or sharp or a mix)
* 1 lime
* salt and pepper, to taste

Cook rice according to package directions and set aside.

While rice is cooking, set oven to broil. Place the poblano peppers skin side down on a rimmed baking sheet and broil for 7 minutes to start softening. Remove from oven and adjust oven to 400.

While peppers are softening in the oven, place cooked rice in a large bowl. Combine black beans, salsa, corn, cumin, chili powder and salt/pepper to taste. Stir the filling until well mixed. 

Spoon the filling into each pepper cavity, as much as it will hold. Top with shredded cheese and place in the oven and bake for 20 minutes until cheese is bubbling. Squeeze lime over top and serve.
