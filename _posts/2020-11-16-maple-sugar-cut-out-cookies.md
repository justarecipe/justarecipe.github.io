_Delicious and sweet cut-out cookies featuring my favorite flavor of maple. Mmm!_

INGREDIENTS

* 2 1/2 cups white all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup wheat flour
* 2 tsp. baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature
* 1 cup dark brown sugar, packed
* 1 egg*
* 1 tsp. maple extract
* 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
* 1 cup powdered sugar
* 1/4 cup maple syrup

Heat oven to 350 and prep two cookie sheets with parchment paper.

In a large bowl, sift together flour, baking powder and salt. Whisk and set aside.

In a mixing stand, cream the butter and brown sugar. Add the egg, maple extract and vanilla extract. Beat until uniform. Add the flour mixture, one cup at a time to allow the cookie dough to mix properly.

Once the flour is fully incorporated, lightly flour a clean flat surface, Roll the cookie dough to approximately 1/4 inch thick. Use your favorite cookie cutter(s) and carefully transfer the cut-out cookies to the prepped cookie sheet.

Bake for 8 minutes. Carefully remove from the cookie sheet and let cool on a wire rack. 

Once cookies have cooled completely, make the maple syrup icing. Combine the powdered sugar and maple syrup in a medium bowl. Whisk the ingredients until the icing comes together. Use a small icing spatula or butter knife to spread the icing on the cookies and enjoy!
