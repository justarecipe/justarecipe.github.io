Time: 40 minutes; Yields 24 mini muffins

An easy egg-free and tasty recipe for toddlers and adults alike. Spinach + bananas + flaxseed meal as an egg substitute results in seriously yummy mini muffins.

INGREDIENTS

* 2 Tbsp. ground flaxseed
* 5 Tbsp. water
* 2 cups oatmeal flour
* 2 tsp. baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. baking soda
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 2 tsp. ground cinnamon
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1/2 cup milk
* 2 cups packed spinach leaves
* 1/4 cup canola oil
* 2 extra ripe bananas
* 2 tsp. vanilla

Heat oven to 375 and grease mini muffin pan. 

Create the flax egg by mixing the ground flaxseed and water in a small bowl. Let rest for 5 minutes to thicken.

Combine the dry ingredients (oatmeal flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and sugar) in a large bowl.

Add milk and spinach to a powerful blender like a Vitamix. Blend together until homogeneous. In the blender, add bananas and canola oil and blend until smooth. Then add vanilla and the flaxseed egg substitute. Blend until combined.

Pour wet ingredients into dry mixture and stir until just combined.

Place batter in the mini muffin pan and bake for 15 minutes or until it passes the toothpick test.
