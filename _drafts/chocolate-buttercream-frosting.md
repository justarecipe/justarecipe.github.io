_Sweet chocolate buttercream frosting that comes together in minutes and is way tastier than store-bought!_

INGREDIENTS

* 2 sticks unsalted butter, room temperature
* 3 1/2 cups powdered sugar
* 1/2 cup cocoa powder
* 3 Tbsp. milk
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 2 tsp. vanilla extract

This recipe requires using a stand mixer and paddle attachment or a large bowl and electric beater. Add the butter to the mixer or bowl and beat on medium speed for 2 minutes, until creamy.

Add the powdered sugar a little at a time, making sure to not create a puff of powdered sugar and mix on a slow speed. Continuing with the slow speed, add the cocoa powder, milk, salt and vanilla extract.

Once all the ingredients are added to the mixer or bowl, increase the mix speed to high and beat for 3 to 5 minutes. 

Use chocolate buttercream to frost cakes and cupcakes.
