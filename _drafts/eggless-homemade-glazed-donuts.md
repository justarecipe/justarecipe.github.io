Time: 4 hours; Yields: 12 donuts plus donut holes

These homemade donuts use a few vegan tricks - aquafaba and ground flaxseed - to fry up the perfect eggless donut. 

INGREDIENTS FOR DONUTS

* 6 Tbsp. aquafaba (water from a chickpea can)
* 2 Tbsp. ground flaxseed
* 6 Tbsp. water
* 5 oz. milk
* 2 oz. coconut oil, melted
* 16 oz (454 g) bread flour*
* 2 oz. sugar
* 1 tsp. salt
* 1 1/2 tsp. quick-rise yeast
* oil for frying (I use vegetable oil)

INGREDIENTS FOR GLAZE

* 1 cup powdered sugar
* 2 Tbsp. milk
* 1/2 tsp. vanilla

Whisk together powdered sugar, milk and vanilla. Once the glaze is smooth and the donuts cool, apply the glaze with pastry
