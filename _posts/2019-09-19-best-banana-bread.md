Time: 1 hour 10 minutes; Yields 2 mini loaves or 1 regular loaf

_The best banana bread recipe that I've been making for the past decade. It comes together quickly and no mixer is required._

INGREDIENTS

* 1/3 cup unsalted butter, melted
* 2 or 3 ripe to very ripe bananas, peeled and mashed
* 1 tsp. baking soda
* pinch of salt
* 3/4 cup sugar
* 1 large egg
* 1 tsp. vanilla extract 
* 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour*

\*if wheat flour isn't your thing, you can substitute for all-purpose flour.

Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease two mini loaf pans or one regular rectangular loaf pan.

Place the mashed bananas in a large mixing bowl and stir in melted butter. Mix to combine.

Mix in the baking soda and salt. Then add the sugar, egg and vanilla extract. Mix to combine. 

Add the flour half a cup at a time and mix until fully incorporated. Pour the batter evenly into the two mini loaf pans or one regular loaf pan.

* Bake 35 to 40 minutes if using mini pans.
* Bake 50 to 60 minutes if using rectangular pan. 

Once it passes the toothpick test, let bread cool in pan for five minutes. Cool on wire rack and enjoy!
